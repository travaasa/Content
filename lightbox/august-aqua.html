			<p style="margin: 0 25px 0 20px;"><span style="color:#d11241; font-size: 18px;">Flavored Water</span><br />Staying hydrated in the summer months is extremely important, but sometimes hard to do. In this 30 minute demonstration you will learn how to make several flavored waters to get you more excited to drink more water and impress your friends and family at your next BBQ</p>

			<p style="margin: 8px 25px 0 20px;"><span style="color:#d11241; font-size: 18px;">Water Splash Aerobics</span><br />The water environment is comfortable for the majority of people. Water creates individualized
resistance, and the buoyancy helps to reduce impact, provides cushion and therefore less pain on the joints. The harder we push at the water the harder it pushes back at us, thereby making the workout as hard as you want it to be. The exercises are either stationary or moving through the water. We use all the muscles of the body in various planes of motion, because the water provides resistance all around the body. It is a good cardiovascular, endurance and flexibility workout. It is also fun and very refreshing during the summer days.</p>

			<p style="margin: 8px 25px 0 20px;"><span style="color:#d11241; font-size: 18px;">Pool Volleyball</span><br />Enjoy a little cool competition as you jump, spike, and dive into action in our amazing infinity pool</p>

			<p style="margin: 8px 25px 0 20px;"><span style="color:#d11241; font-size: 18px;">Aqua Yoga</span><br />One of the most important factors in maintaining a healthy body is a flexible spine, therefore, in this class which is done in our infinity pool we bring intention to healing the spine.  We practice a combination of back bends, forward bends, twists, and postures which elongate the spine in order to strengthen and bring flexibility to the spine.</p>
