			<br>
			Welcome to Travaasa Destinations ('Travaasa') website  ('Site'). This Site is offered as a service to our 
			customers and guests.  Travaasa, its subsidiaries and affiliates, or other members of our family of  companies 
			value your business and loyalty. We are committed to the protection  of consumer privacy. Travaasa has created 
			this privacy policy in order to  demonstrate its commitment to the privacy and protection of your personal  
			information. To better protect your privacy, Travaasa provides this notice  explaining our information practices 
			and the choices you can make about the way  your information is collected and used.
			<br><br>
			<p style="font-size:16px; color: #D11241; margin:10px 0 4px 0;">1. Personal Information Collection</p>
			<br>
			Travaasa may collect personal information like name,  telephone number, email address, date of birth, home or 
			business mailing  address, and details regarding your mode of travel when you access certain  areas of the 
			Site that require registration for certain services, or if you  require more information about those services.   
			If you decide to make reservations or purchase our services, we may need  to collect certain additional 
			information, like your credit or debit card  number and expiration date.
			<br><br>
			At other times, Travaasa may collect information that cannot  be used to identify you. For example, we may 
			aggregate non-personal information  about you and other customers who visit our Site. Aggregated information 
			will  not contain any information that can be linked directly back to you. 
			<br><br>
			<p style="font-size:16px; color: #D11241; margin:10px 0 4px 0;">2. How Travaasa Collects Personal Information</p> 
			<br>
			Travaasa may use any number of tools to collect information  about you, your computer access points, and the 
			web browser that you use to connect to our Site. For example, cookies are tiny text files that we place on  
			your computer's hard drive when you visit our Site. We may use cookies to  personalize your Site experience. 
			You do not have to accept our cookies and you  may delete them after they have been placed on your hard drive.  
			If you do not accept or delete our cookies, some areas of our Site that you access may take more time to work, 
			or may not function properly.   
			<br><br>
			Travaasa may also collect additional information from your web browser each time you visit our Site. We may 
			collect information on the pages that you visit, the promotions or advertisements that you click on, and  
			other actions that you take while using our Site. This information may include  your Internet Protocol ('IP') 
			address, the type of browser, the time that your browser was used to access our Site, and the referring website 
			address. 
			<br><br>
			Our Internet Service Providers (defined below) may also use  other standard web-based technologies to analyze 
			your movements while accessing  our Site. The technologies include web  'beacons,' 'pixel tags,' and 'clear 
			gifs.' These technologies help us ascertain  the effectiveness of our product and service campaigns and marketing 
			programs,  allow us to customize the services offered on or through our Site, and help  determine the best use 
			for Site content, and product and service offerings.  Some of this information, including the IP address, may be 
			stored on our  Internet service provider's server logs, and may be available for extended  periods of time.
			<br><br>
			<p style="font-size:16px; color: #D11241; margin:10px 0 4px 0;">3. Our Use  and Disclosure of Your Personal Information</p>
			<br>
			Travaasa uses the services of independent companies to  provide certain services to you, including, without 
			limitation, website hosting  services, credit card processing, reservations processing, airline and car  
			rental services, and guest surveys ('Internet Service Providers'). Travaasa may  share your personal information 
			with the Internet Service Providers as appropriate. We do not share personally identifiable information with 
			outside  third parties without your consent, except to the extent necessary to complete  your request for 
			services offered through this Site.  
			<br><br>
			Travaasa may use your personal information to contact you via  mail, email, or telephone in order to give you 
			updates about Travaasa's special  events, new services, reservation confirmations, or other promotions that 
			may  be of interest to you. If you are a business or organization that has scheduled  a conference, event, 
			or meeting at our facility, we may also share your  personal information with our event organizers. We also 
			use return e-mail  addresses to answer the e-mail we receive from you. Your e-mail address will  not be used 
			for any other purpose or shared with outside third parties for  their direct marketing purposes. We may also 
			use your IP address to help  protect Travaasa and our Internet Service Providers from fraud.
			<br><br>
			Additional uses of your non-personal and personal information  will allow us to tailor products and services 
			specific to your needs, to help  organize and manage your customer relationship and our business, to conduct  
			business, to provide you with customer and guest support, to perform functions  that are described to you at 
			the time of collection, and to enforce our Site's Terms and Conditions of Use.   
			<br><br>
			We may also use non-personal aggregate information to  improve our Site. For example, our Internet Service 
			Providers may report to us  that there were a particular number of visitors to a certain area of our Site,  
			or that a certain number of men or a certain number of women completed our  registration form in particular 
			areas of our Site. Such information may also be  used to analyze the effectiveness of our business and advertising 
			models.
			<br><br>
			If you submit a resume or seek to fulfill other staffing  requirements, we will use that information solely 
			in connection with your  application for current or future staffing requirements, and we may also share  your 
			resume or application information with our business partners or affiliates  that have staffing requirements 
			that you may be qualified for.
			<br><br>
			Travaasa may also disclose your personal information as is  necessary to: (a) comply with a subpoena or court 
			order; (b) cooperate with law  enforcement or other government agency; (c) establish or exercise our legal  
			rights; (d) protect the property or safety of our company and employees,  contractors, vendors, and suppliers; 
			(e) defend against legal claims; (f) help  with internal and external investigations; or (g) as otherwise 
			required by law  or permitted by law. We may disclose your information in connection with the sale or merger 
			of Travaasa or any transaction that involves the sale or assignment of some or all of our assets.
			<br><br>
			<p style="font-size:16px; color: #D11241; margin:10px 0 4px 0;">4. Data Storage and Security</p>
			<br>
			 Travaasa makes reasonable efforts to ensure that our Internet Service Providers  have implemented physical, 
			 electronic, and procedural security measures to  assist with safeguarding your personal information, and to 
			 help protect against  unauthorized access and disclosure. Only our authorized personnel and our  Internet 
			 Service Providers who perform legitimate business functions for  Travaasa are authorized to access your 
			 personal information.
			 <br><br>
			 Notwithstanding our efforts, the Internet has inherent  security risks. Travaasa cannot promise, and you 
			 should not expect, that your  personal information, personal searches, and other communications will always  
			 remain secure. You should take care with regard to how you handle and disclose  your personal information 
			 or any username or password that you are required to  use to access services on this Site.
			 <br><br> 
			<p style="font-size:16px; color: #D11241; margin:10px 0 4px 0;">5. Children and Data Collection</p>
			<br>
			Travaasa's Site is a general audience  Site. Travaasa's content is neither directed toward minors nor children 
			who are  under the age of 13.  We do not knowingly  collect personal information from children under the age 
			of 13 without parental  consent.  If Travaasa or its Internet  Service Providers become aware that a minor or 
			a child under the age of 13 has  provided us with personal information without the parental consent, that  
			information will be deleted from our databases.   Parents who have questions about personal information that 
			may have been  submitted by a child under the age of 13 should email us at  privacypolicy@travaasa.com.
			<br><br>

			<p style="font-size:16px; color: #D11241; margin:10px 0 4px 0;">6. How You May  Access and Change the Information that Travaasa Collects</p>
			<br>
			The first time that you provide us with registration  information through our Site, you may be offered the 
			opportunity to subscribe  to and receive additional information about our products and services. After  your 
			first use, you can change your initial choices by contacting customer  service e-mail at 
			<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@travaasa.com">privacypolicy@travaasa.com</a>. 
			Each commercial e-mail that  we send to you, will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of continuing to  
			receive such messages.  We may take up to  10 business days to process your opt-out requests. In some instances, 
			we may  have already shared your information with one of our authorized third parties  before you changed your 
			information preferences. In those cases, you may have  to directly contact those third parties to opt-out of 
			receiving their  communications.
			<br><br>
			FTC email compliance guidance allows us to send you  transactional and relationship e-mail without offering 
			you the opportunity to  opt-out of receiving those types of e-mail.
			<br><br>
