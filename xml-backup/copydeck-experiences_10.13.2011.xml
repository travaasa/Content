The Travaasa language is the intimate grammar of discovery, experience and a celebration of local culture. At Travaasa you'll uncover where you want to journey. And what you want to find on your way.

					<h1>Prickly Pear Challenge Course (Austin)</h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>Ever picked a prickly pear? If you have, you know the importance of each foot and hand placement as you find your way between the cactus needles. The same focus on movement is required as you navigate the space above the trees on our challenge course. Our state-of-the-art course was designed in partnership with Outward Bound Professional, and incorporates vertical climbing elements for a wide range of physical ability. Begin at the Cob Web, progress over Raider Bridge, through the Flying V, to navigate Double Trouble. The linear progression of the course culminates with a fantastic flight of over 250 feet long, soaring over the tree tops.</p>
					<h2>Climbing Wall</h2>
					<p>Ready to feel exhilarated and have a real sense of accomplishment that you did something out of your comfort zone? Our climbing wall at the Prickly Pear Challenge Course will entertain and test both first timers and experienced climbers alike. You’ll love the feeling of challenging yourself to reach new heights while daring yourself to trust your body and go beyond your (perceived) limitations. </p>
					<h2>Zipline</h2>
					<p>There's no other feeling like that of a zip line—the sensation of flying and the freedom afforded by your journey down the cable—is at once exhilarating and empowering. At Travaasa Austin, the  linear progression of our course culminates with a fantastic dual zip line flight over 250 feet long, soaring above the tree tops. </p>
					<h2>Partner Overview: Outward Bound</h2>
					<p>For more than 60 years, Outward Bound has proven that they are simply the best at what they do as the premier adventure-based education program in the world. Most people know that Outward Bound has a nationwide system of wilderness courses, community-centric and special programming, but many may not be familiar with the Outward Bound Professional program, whose goal is to create positive, lasting change in the workplace through innovative, customized programs that enhance the effectiveness of individuals, groups and organizations. Travaasa celebrates our partnership with this revered leader in experiential learning and discovery. </p>]]>

Our guides will point out various native plants (as well as &ldquo;canoe plants,&rdquo; plants that were brought to Hawai&rsquo;i by the first Polynesians over 1,300 years ago to ensure their survival). You&rsquo;ll also see the picturesque &lsquo;Ālau Island, a bird sanctuary with an unbelievable grouping of wind-tossed palm trees at its summit. Many of our guides were raised in Hāna, and will share their own personal <em>mo&lsquo;olelo</em> (stories) of growing up in this place of great beauty.</p>
						<h2>Walk to Hamoa Beach</h2>
						<p>A three-mile walk from the hotel, Hamoa Beach is a broad curve of untouched sand described by the late Pulitzer Prize winner James Michener as &ldquo;The most perfect crescent beach in the Pacific.&rdquo; Sheltered by lush foliage on its western side, this is a not-to-be-missed beach with perfect waves for boogie boarding* and the trademark indigo Hawaiian ocean with patches of bright, vivid clear blue. The walk takes you past the famous <em>Ka-iwi-o-Pele</em> hill which is said to hold the bones of Pele, Goddess of Fire (and the Hawaiian Volcano Goddess), and broad ranchland with free-roaming cows and egrets. Spectacular views in every direction, with the end of your journey, Hamoa Beach, being a real showstopper.</p>]]>

					<h1>Tastings (Austin)</h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>Sip. Surrender. Savor. Plunge into the Travaasa Tastings and give your palate an education unlike any other. Discover the subtle nuances between olive oils, the zip and tang of barbecue sauces, decadent chocolates and the rich ripeness of artisanal cheeses. And of course, there’s the whole world of beverages ready to delight in: aromatic coffees, handcrafted beers, tea flights, spirits from craft distillers and even the differences in coconut milks. And your experience wouldn’t be complete without exploring the many, many flavors of regional cuisines.</p>
					<h2>Wines (Austin)</h2>
					<p>Wine appreciation can sound daunting and complicated. Let us step in with this Travaasa that “undaunts” and underscores all the important things you need to know and understand about enjoying wine. First of all, wine is not just about knowing what you like. There is a difference between objective quality and subjective enjoyment. So let yourself surrender to different tastes you might never get to experience again. </p><p>We'll start with the bottle itself. Much of the magic of wine lies in being able to properly evaluate bottles, which in turn can lead to an understanding of wine's history and origins. Then we'll move on to learning the skill of wine appreciation by tasting and evaluating wines with experts in the field (top wines can come from many regions, but they all have certain characteristics in common). You'll learn how to analyze the various flavors, aromas and textures of grapes, and you'll have a chance to taste quality wines, which will be provided along with water and appropriate snacks.</p>]]>

					<h1>Nutrition (Austin)</h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>Food, glorious food. It nourishes, delights and is the focus of many of our social gatherings. Our delicious Nutrition Series is designed to help you understand the importance of developing your palette, filling your body with health through juicing, navigating the marketplace and more.</p>
					<h2>Acclimating the Palette</h2>
					<p>When you are hungry, what do you crave? The number one behavioral reason we choose to eat something is taste. It is a primal force. Training taste is no different than training your muscles or your mind. In this Travaasa, we show you how to acclimate your palette while we take you on a sensory trek that goes beyond base camp to elevate your tastes to higher ground and, better health. And along the way we'll also explore edible plants that many of us aren't even aware of (there are actually over a hundred thousand). </p>
					<h2>Nourish Flourish</h2>
					<p>Rejuvenation, enrichment, metamorphisis, vitality. Food serves it all. Plants sprout, grow, produce, harvest and nourish all so we can flourish: by eating well and fresh. Developing an awareness within our modern world of the impact embodied in our consumption, and the ecological production of what we eat, is an invigorating inquiry. Across the spectrum of health, wellness and fitness, food offers vital performance for everyone—discover how you can flourish from all the nourishing foods available to us. </p>
					<h2>Navigating the Market</h2>
					<p>Shopping for groceries has turned into a treasure hunt. The clues, maps, symbols and signs that lead you to eat well—live, fresh food are there to be discovered. Revealing blind spots and demystifying hidden market secrets will help you navigate the deep waters of food processing and packaging. Consider this as a brighter way into defining ingredients. Your awareness alone immediately translates into discernable action.</p>

					<h1>Nutrition (Austin)</h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>Food, glorious food. It nourishes, delights and is the focus of many of our social gatherings. Our delicious Nutrition Series is designed to help you understand the importance of developing your palette, filling your body with health through juicing, navigating the marketplace and more.</p>
					<h2>Acclimating the Palette</h2>
					<p>When you are hungry, what do you crave? The number one behavioral reason we choose to eat something is taste. It is a primal force. Training taste is no different than training your muscles or your mind. In this Travaasa, we show you how to acclimate your palette while we take you on a sensory trek that goes beyond base camp to elevate your tastes to higher ground and, better health. And along the way we'll also explore edible plants that many of us aren't even aware of (there are actually over a hundred thousand). </p>
					<h2>Nourish Flourish</h2>
					<p>Rejuvenation, enrichment, metamorphisis, vitality. Food serves it all. Plants sprout, grow, produce, harvest and nourish all so we can flourish: by eating well and fresh. Developing an awareness within our modern world of the impact embodied in our consumption, and the ecological production of what we eat, is an invigorating inquiry. Across the spectrum of health, wellness and fitness, food offers vital performance for everyone—discover how you can flourish from all the nourishing foods available to us. </p>
					<h2>Navigating the Market</h2>
					<p>Shopping for groceries has turned into a treasure hunt. The clues, maps, symbols and signs that lead you to eat well—live, fresh food are there to be discovered. Revealing blind spots and demystifying hidden market secrets will help you navigate the deep waters of food processing and packaging. Consider this as a brighter way into defining ingredients. Your awareness alone immediately translates into discernable action.</p>

					<h1>Tastings (Austin)</h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>Sip. Surrender. Savor. Plunge into the Travaasa Tastings and give your palate an education unlike any other. Discover the subtle nuances between olive oils, the zip and tang of barbecue sauces, decadent chocolates and the rich ripeness of artisanal cheeses. And of course, there’s the whole world of beverages ready to delight in: aromatic coffees, handcrafted beers, tea flights, spirits from craft distillers and even the differences in coconut milks. And your experience wouldn’t be complete without exploring the many, many flavors of regional cuisines.</p>
					<h2>Wines (Austin)</h2>
					<p>Wine appreciation can sound daunting and complicated. Let us step in with this Travaasa that “undaunts” and underscores all the important things you need to know and understand about enjoying wine. First of all, wine is not just about knowing what you like. There is a difference between objective quality and subjective enjoyment. So let yourself surrender to different tastes you might never get to experience again. </p><p>We'll start with the bottle itself. Much of the magic of wine lies in being able to properly evaluate bottles, which in turn can lead to an understanding of wine's history and origins. Then we'll move on to learning the skill of wine appreciation by tasting and evaluating wines with experts in the field (top wines can come from many regions, but they all have certain characteristics in common). You'll learn how to analyze the various flavors, aromas and textures of grapes, and you'll have a chance to taste quality wines, which will be provided along with water and appropriate snacks.</p>]]>

					<copy><![CDATA[<p>Every hula tells a story, and you&rsquo;ll learn all the graceful hand and foot movements that go along with telling it. Hula is more than just a dance&mdash;it is something that links Hawaiians to <em>&lsquo;</em><em>Āina</em> (land) and <em>Kai</em> (ocean) and in broader terms, to the story of life. Hula is traditionally a way that stories and traditions were passed from generation to generation. Originally, hula was danced by men, but now it is performed by both men and women. You&rsquo;ll learn a story from one of our cultural guides, your <em>kumu</em> (teacher) who&rsquo;s been practicing hula since childhood.&nbsp;</p>]]>

					<h1>Ecology (Hāna)</h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>The beauty and biodiversity of Hawai&rsquo;i is unlike anywhere else on Earth. The islands form the most remote archipelago on earth, 2,500 miles from the nearest land mass. The native flora and fauna developed in isolation in the rich, volcanic soil, with new species occasionally arriving by accident via wind, water or wings. Early explorers also contributed, bringing plants and seeds endemic to their own culture. We invite you to learn more about Hawaii&rsquo;s ecological wonders and discover yet another reason why it&rsquo;s recognized the world over as paradise.</p>
					<h2>Canoe Plants/Taro</h2>
					<p>The story of these unique plants begins 1,300 years ago when Polynesian explorers loaded their canoes with a precious cargo of plants, shoots and seeds. These explorers not only had to sustain themselves throughout the journey, but it was very wise to bring a &ldquo;taste of home&rdquo; since they had no idea what awaited them. Now you have the opportunity to explore the property and learn how Hawaiians have used these unique plants to define their way of life. Plants like taro, believed to have the greatest life force of all foods.&nbsp;</p>
					<h2>Garden Walk</h2>
					<p>Join us for a journey around the beautiful Travaasa property as we learn about the lush plants and flowers that adorn our grounds, the rich history of the resort and the very special town and people of Hāna.</p>
					<h2>Tidal Pools</h2>
					<p>Join us on an ecological excursion to discover the marine life in the tidal pools of Hāna. On our exploration we&rsquo;ll visit several different pools on the reef, each with a different ecosystem. We&rsquo;ll take a look at a few of the undersea creatures native to Hawaii such as eels, crustaceans, and mollusks and examine early marine development. Finally, you&rsquo;ll learn about the cultural importance of the ocean in sustaining the Hawaiian people while understanding traditional gathering practices and food customs.</p>]]>

					<copy><![CDATA[<p>You probably didn’t see this one coming, but you are in Austin, after all. After you’ve gotten your muscles primed with pilates or our core conditioning Travaasa, graduate to our mechanical bull for a core workout that’s unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. Riding the bull increases strength and improves flexibility because it’s continually moving—up, down, right and left—purposely keeping you off-balance. It’s a ride that forces you to use your leg muscles to grip the sides of the bull, and your core muscles to flex as you move forward and back. And lastly, form does count, so don’t forget to raise one arm up in the air to maintain your balance (bonus points if you have a cowboy hat). And you thought cowboys were just being cool waving their hats around in the air!</p>]]>

					<h1>Yoga for Mind and Body (Austin) </h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>Yoga is a wonderful technique to heal, detoxify and unify your mind and body. It can help fortify your awareness of movement, balance and intention, in addition to strengthening your body (through vinyasa yoga). No matter your age, strength or flexibility level, anyone can do yoga with the right attitude and the right teacher. And if you are new to yoga, you’ll find a physical path that harmonizes mind, body and soul. Yoga combines physical activity with breath to reduce stress, control weight, relieve lower back pain and enhance focus. Our yoga classes include various styles and routines that create a dynamic, challenging program which combines strength, spirituality and a healthy dose of sweat.</p>
					<h2>Yoga: Aquatic</h2>
					<p>Practicing yoga in the water can provide a number of benefits. First of all, it feels great. The wiggly-waggly way water feels when you bend and stretch will have you experiencing childhood again. But water also acts as a safeguard against injuries that are more likely to occur on land. Your movements become smoother in water and therefore your body will not experience the same strain as on terra firma. There are a few poses which are even easier practiced in water, such as the standing eagle pose or tree pose. You can perform these effortlessly in water because the ripples that are created in the water force your body to maintain the necessary pose. </p>
					<h2>Yoga: Awakening the Joints</h2>
					<p>This is a “must-do” Travaasa if you sometimes feel aches and pains in your ankles, knees, elbows, wrists, shoulders and hips. And if you’re over the age of 30, you know what we mean. In this class we focus on yoga postures and stretches to bring greater movement to the body through awakening and stimulating stiff joints. And all without having to dip into the Glucosamine and Chondroitin.  </p>
					<h2>Yoga: Bhava </h2>
					<p>Envisoned by Travaasa yoga expert Susan Anderson, Bhava yoga invites us to connect with the world beyond ourselves. The word Bhava loosely translates as "An expansion of feeling and sentiment in the heart through song and chant" and Bhava can transform you, but it calls for the surrender of your ego and sense of self. Join us for a unique yoga experience that will alter the way you think about yoga. </p>
					<h2>Yoga: Hatha (All Levels) </h2>
					<p>Wake up your body and mind with this flowing yoga practice that accommodates all levels of practitioners. Energize yourself with traditional morning Sun Salutations (a linking of breath and motion) and other Hatha yoga poses. This is a low-to-moderate-intensity class, geared toward everyone with an interest in yoga, and will allow those who are newer to take their time, while letting seasoned practitioners pick up the intensity.  </p>
					<h2>Yoga: Spine Work </h2>
					<p>One of the most important factors in maintaining a healthy body is a flexible spine. Yogis say that youth is determined by the flexibility of your spine (which means, with a physically sound spine, 50 might really be the new 30). Lower back pain and upper back stress are some of the most common health complaints of adults. The best way to avoid backaches is to take care of your spine on a daily basis. There is no quick fix for back pain, but our exercise set is an effective maintenance program. In this Travaasa we practice a combination of back bends and forward bends to strengthen and bring flexibility to the spine. We will also learn some gentle stretches you can do on your own to relieve and prevent back pain.  </p>
					<h2>Yoga: Bar</h2>
					<p>Combining the best of both worlds, the flowing movements of dance with the meditative qualities of yoga, this slow, ballet-bar based yoga was designed by Travaasa Austin's resident yogi Susan Anderson to provide an experience that draws from both yoga fundamentals and the movements and principles or dance. Bar Yoga will rejuvenate your body, mind and soul. </p>

					<h1>Yoga for Mind and Body (Hāna)</h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>Yoga at Travaasa Hāna is unlike yoga anywhere else in the world. Our instructors bring years of training and knowledge, our yoga classes are varied and unique, and the location (outdoor or in our open-air Wellness Center) will reinvigorate you with its sheer beauty and calm. It&rsquo;s widely known that yoga is a wonderful technique to heal, detoxify and unify your mind and body. It can help fortify your awareness of movement, balance and intention, in addition to strengthening your body (through vinyasa yoga). No matter your age, strength or flexibility level, anyone can do yoga with the right attitude and the right teacher. And if you are new to yoga, you&rsquo;ll find a physical path that harmonizes mind, body and soul. Yoga combines physical activity with breath to reduce stress, control weight, relieve lower back pain and enhance focus.&nbsp;</p>
					<h2>Basic</h2>
					<p>A peaceful form of exercise helping you increase flexibility, strength, balance and inner awareness.&nbsp; Connecting breath and body movement that will enhance each posture as you relax and inhale the tropical warmth of Hāna's fresh air and rejuvenating powers.&nbsp; All levels are welcome.</p>
					<h2>Inner Landscape</h2>
					<p>This soft, gentle yoga experience is designed to help you open your body and mind. Move into unique postures designed to emulate the distinctive, varying landscapes of Hawaii as you focus on your senses and soak in the beauty of Hāna.</p>
					<h2>Gentle Hatha</h2>
					<p>Hatha may be the most common form of yoga practiced by Westerners, but practicing it in Hāna elevates it to an uncommonly spectacular level. We&rsquo;ll start with traditional Sun Salutations (a linking of breath and motion) and other Hatha yoga poses. First timers are invited to join more seasoned practitioners. This is a class aimed at everyone and moves at a pace you&rsquo;re comfortable with. And really, what&rsquo;s the hurry? The goal is to energize your body and mind.&nbsp;</p>
					<h2>Yin</h2>
					<p>If you&rsquo;re a yoga practitioner, you may be doing only one part the asana practice. Challenge yourself with the slower, gentler discipline of Yin Yoga. Some consider it the original form of asana practice that is now being &ldquo;re-discovered&rdquo; by students. Yin practitioners can remain in postures from one to an amazing twenty minutes because it targets the connective tissues. These are the ligaments, bone and joints of the body that are not exercised much in other forms of yoga. Yin strengthens the hips and lower back and increases the flow of energy, allowing you to sit for long periods in contemplative meditation. This class is open everyone with an interest in yoga.&nbsp;</p>
					<h2>Flow</h2>
					<p>Challenge your body and mind with a Vinyasa flow style class. Vinyasa yoga focuses on integrating breath with movement, awareness with alignment and strength with flexibility. In this class you will explore how individual yoga postures and sequences work together by creating a smooth series of postures that run together and seem to flow like a rhythmic dance.</p>
					<h2>Spine</h2>
					<p>Yogis say youth is determined by the flexibility of your spine: if we can keep a healthy spine, the rest of the body follows suit. In this class we will practice a combination of back bends and forward bends to strengthen and bring flexibility to the spine. Lower back pain and upper back stress are some of the most common health complaints of adults. The best way to avoid backaches is to take care of your spine on a daily basis. Here we will also learn some gentle stretches you can do on your own to relieve and prevent back pain. There are no quick fixes for back pain, but this exercise set is an effective maintenance program.</p>]]>

					<h1><![CDATA[Zumba&reg; (Austin)]]></h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>The word Zumba is Colombian slang for “buzz like a bee” or “move very fast.” This Travaasa uses Latin dance, hip-hop, belly dancing and Reggaeton (a form of Latin hip-hop) choreography to tone the body and whittle abs, all while feeling like you are at a dance party… not sweating through a workout. Interval training keeps the body at an efficient and consistent fat-burning level throughout. Zumba’s slogan is “Ditch the workout. Join the party!” which makes it the perfect workout for the exercise-resistant. </p>]]>

					<h1>Meditation (Austin)</h1>
					<copy><![CDATA[<p>Meditation is a wonderful way to decompress after a stressful day—or to start your day in a calming state of mind. We offer three different points of view on meditation, and all are easy to learn and incorporate into your daily life.</p>
					<h2>Meditation: Wake-Up</h2>
					<p>Start your morning with a meditation experience designed to get your day off to a balanced start.</p>
					<h2>Meditation: Chakra </h2>
					<p>Within our bodies there are focal points of energy that we use (whether consciously or unconsciously), to allow us to fully experience and realize events that unfold before us. These focal points of energy are called Chakras. The word Chakra is Sanskrit for "wheel," and there are seven primary Chakra points in the body—each like a moving wheel of energy, ready to help you tune out, and tune into yourself. When one of the chakra centers is out of balance, it effects other centers. When one chakra center is out of balance, you are out of balance. Balance the chakra centers through meditation, and you will feel balanced throughout your day.</p>
					<h2>Meditation: Guided </h2>
					<p>In this Travaasa, we help demystify the ancient practice of meditation—bringing awareness to our moment-to-moment experiences. This simple—but not easy—practice of acceptance, letting go, non-striving and suspension of the judgmental mind leaves us with a deep sense of openness and receptivity to ourselves, to others and to the moment as it unfolds.</p>]]>

This Travaasa works with the breath, following its movements through the body. Restorative sequencing moves us slowly into a deep somatic experience to release us from stress and anxiety and bring a calmer, more relaxed state (great for type-A personalities who have trouble relaxing). As we turn the lens inward, we will learn more about the asana—the breath—and ourselves.</p>

Specifically, how each face tells a story of what is happening inside the body. You'll learn simple yet effective steps you can take to look and feel better-sans pills, chemicals or complicated recipes.  Fountain of youth, move over.</p>
